			This is the worst part of the love-is-blind bias. We’ll discuss the consequences of being blindly in love below.

The consequences of blind love
The biggest consequences of blind love revolve around social criticism. Our emotions are so strong that they block out pretty much everything else. When you can’t see your partner’s flaws, their misdeeds are reinterpreted, justified, or completely erased from memory.

If your partner is hurting you in some way, you don’t really care. When you suffer from blind love, you’re so focused on the other person that any kind of negative emotion associated with them is wiped away. They can do whatever they want, because you’re incapable of maintaining even the slightest objectivity towards them. Your mind is able to justify anything they do.

If your child is the school bully, you justify their behavior as self-defense. If they get bad grades, it’s the teacher’s fault for not explaining the material properly. If they talk back to you, it’s because everything they have to do is stressing them out. If your partner lies to you, it’s because they wanted to protect you. If they don’t want to hang out with you, it’s because they have a lot of work to do. If they cheated on you, it’s because you didn’t give them what they needed. When it comes to blind love, it’s always someone else’s fault.

In short, when you’re caught in the grip of blind love, you turn yourself over completely to the other person, and you forget much of what and who you are. They could be unfaithful to you or hurt you in some other way, but the deep love that you feel for them prevents you from doing anything about it.

“Falling in love is a state of mental misery in which your awareness shrinks, deteriorates, and paralyzes.”
